                    <p> This is a nice private well cleared campsite on the property of a very nice friendly couple. Short walk from driveway to campsite. Totally private. Fire ring already supplied w kindling and tons of firewood nearby. Owners have several cats some of which are very friendly and inquisitive but largely left us alone. Kelly’s Run nearby was an awesome beautiful moderately difficult hike. If you like road riding, this area is perfect for you. Huge rolling hills though not much in the way of shoulder. Discovered a rail trail about 20 minutes away near the Turkey Hill Campus. Was beautiful! We will definitely return.</p>
